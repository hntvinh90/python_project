<name>The Promise to Stop at Two</name>
<describe>Should concern for the environment influence a person's family planning decisions? We tell why some people are promising to only have two children.</describe>
<steps>34497::What things should parents consider when starting a family?
41831::Many people immediately think about the money they need to start a family.
49027::Having a baby means getting more food and buying supplies the baby might need.
58564:: It can also mean losing money if a parent cannot work for a short time after the baby is born.
69092::
70091::Other people might think about the work required to have a baby.
76963::Babies require feeding often.
81235::They often wake up in the middle of the night.
87064::This can limit a person's sleep.
91290::Many people think about these kinds of things when starting a family.
98959::But, would you consider the result or influence of a baby on the environment?
108874::Would you choose not to have a child if you knew it would negatively affect the environment?
119156::
120705::Some people are making exactly that choice. 
126418::They are choosing to stop having children to protect the environment. 
134001::
143331::That is, the group encourages people to have no more than two children. 
151612::They say this is the best chance for keeping our environment healthy for future generations.
161650::
163896::The Optimum Population Trust, or OPT, is a group concerned with ...
172503::... how population growth affects the environment.
177548::The OPT believes the human population is growing too fast for the Earth to support it
188116::If the population gets too big the Earth will run out of resources for people to live on.
198105::The OPT works mainly in the United Kingdom. 
204756::But they believe their ideas are important for people everywhere.
211561::
213162::Currently, the world's population is over 6.8 billion.
221128::But by the year 2050, that number may be closer to 9.1 billion! 
231332::Many experts are concerned that the earth's resources ...
237337::... will not be able to serve so many people.
242556::
243588::A growing population affects the environment in many ways.
249923::For example, every person around the world creates waste.
256625::But more people create more waste.
261715::They use more natural resources.
266159::They expel more carbon dioxide and other harmful gases into the environment. 
275034::Jonathon Porritt supports the OPT.
279632::He explains that each extra person in the United Kingdom alone ...
286963::... produces an extra eleven tons of carbon dioxide every year.
294132::Add this to an increasing fertility rate.
299989::The OPT expects the population of the UK to increase by 16 million in about 50 years.
313015::However, if UK women would stop after having two children, that number could change. 
322883::The population could grow by only 9 million instead.
329429::
332941::Many people around the world are already concerned with their influence on the environment.
341653::People reuse things. 
344626::They try to reduce the waste they produce.
349190::Or they work to save resources in other ways.
354834::But are they willing to change their plans for a family ...
361032::... because of their concerns? Mr. Porritt says:
367110::"People should connect their concerns about the natural environment ...
373511::...with their decisions as possible parents.
377793::Every new human being is increasing the load on this planet."
385189::
391614::People cannot completely stop having children.
396948::This would cause the human population to decrease and finally die out. 
405078::Also, people want to have children. 
409811::But people can limit the size of their family. 
415186::So, the OPT encourages people to stop after having two children. 
423607::This way, people can still have children and do a good thing for the environment.
432966::
433321::The OPT has come up with a plan to encourage people to stop after having two children.
444491::They call it the "Stop at Two Pledge."
449934::The Pledge is a promise to try not to have more than two children.
458154::People can visit the OPT's website to sign the pledge. 
465570::They then depend on that person to have two or less children. 
473202::The Pledge says "Having a smaller family - just one or two children ...
481852::... instead of three or more - helps to reverse, or slow down, population growth.
491878::And by reversing population growth, ...
495974::... we would be taking another green step towards environmental survival for all."
504845::
509573::But there are people who disagree with the OPT. 
515289::They say that having more children does not always mean much more waste.
523411::In fact, having more children can mean that a family produces less waste,  ...
531386::... when it is divided by each person. 
534852::Rosie Whitehouse lives in the UK. 
539552::She has five children. She says:
544049::"Just because you have five children it does not mean ...
550664::... you have five times the amount of plastic play toys.
555856::You just have to say ‘no more'."
560334::
561784::Other people say having a large family means having a large support group. 
570244::More children can take care of older or sick parents.
577412::Or they can support each other if something bad happens.
583812::
586897::The BBC news group wrote a story about the OPT's Stop at Two Pledge.
595838::They invited readers to share their opinions. 
601125::One person wrote:
603779::"Is having more than two children selfish? 
609203::No. Environmental extremists are selfish for telling the rest of the world ...
617271::... what it may or may not do!"
621368::
622284::Another commenter wrote:
625229::"The environment is one of the reasons we have decided not to have any children.
635099::We would not want any child of ours to live in the sad future that is coming.
644152::The world cannot support the people it has already got. 
650303:: Having lots of children shows a lack of thought and care, in my opinion."
659325::
660875::And a third commenter, named Linden suggested another answer to the problem.
669071::
669119::"I would agree it is selfish and not responsible to have more than two children. 
680599:: It is sad that the environment does not impact more of our decisions.
689601::It makes me very sad that these people who decide ...
696060::... they need a large family do not seem to consider adoption.
703119::There are many children already in this world ...
708874::... who would gain a lot from a loving home.
713624::Surely this is a far better way to have a large family?"
721377::
725612::Having children is a personal decision.
729568::People must decide for themselves how many children they want to have.
737590::The OPT is very clear that they do not want to tell anyone ...
745543::... what they must do - only what they can do.
